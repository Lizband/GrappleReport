Server is Linux & windows
Development for server builds.

Client is Linux & Windows
Shipping for client builds.

The upload batch files are included for updating the linode remote servers.


FO_server.bat connects to the remote linux servers & runs the .sh file

updateFadeoutServers.sh is the sh file. Put that on a linux server with steam installed.

Server depots are visible on steam DB. I wont be writing them here.. BUt windows ends with "1" and linux ends with "2"

Make sure you upload the SERVER folder for server builds you dummy.
